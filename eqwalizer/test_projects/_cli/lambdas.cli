 Methodology notes:
 - "lambda called directly" means code like:  `(fun(X) -> X end)(2)`. These typically only
 exist when created via macros such as `-define(LAZY(X), fun() -> X end).`
 - a "non-macro-line-lambda" is a lambda *not* on the same line as a macro. This is helpful for seeing
 stats that don't include lambdas generated from macros.
 - A "last-in-case-clause" lambda is a lambda that is the last expression in a `case` clause.
 - stats do not include named fun expressions, for which there are around 26 in waserver as of 2021-05-06,
    case-sensitive regex: `[^\w]fun\s+\w+\s*\(`. 10 of the named fun expressions are recursive.
 - run this analysis with `-v` for verbose output, including all uncategorized uses of lambdas.
